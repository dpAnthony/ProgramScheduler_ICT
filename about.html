				<h4>The Program Planner</h4>
				<p>The Program Planner serves as a tool for graduate students earning their M.S. degree in Information & Communication Technology.

After creating an account and logging in, one will be able to access the Program Planner to easily and quickly lay out a semester-by-semester plan of completion. These plans will be used to determine course availability per semester based on demand as well as a resource for you and your program director.</p>

				<h4>The Site</h4>
				<p>This website was made by GSSO (the Graduate School & Stout Online) as part of the Instructional Design process, spearheaded by Byron Anderson. Its purpose is to provide M.S. ICT graduate students with a convenient tool to assist in planning the course of their education, while providing the program director much-needed and real-time information about course demand.</p>
